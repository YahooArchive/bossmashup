Welcome to the Boss Mashup Framework - an experimental, proof-of-concept library
for operating on Boss Search results and web data sources in a SQL like fashion.

I. Installation
===============

[1] First, download and install python 2.5

http://www.python.org/download/

[2] Then download and install simplejson

simplejson
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/

Save this anywhere you can cd to via the terminal

Decompress the file

> tar -xzvf simplejson-1.9.2.tar.gz
> cd <new_folder>

Then install

> sudo python setup.py build
> sudo python setup.py install

[3] Then download and install oauth

oauth
https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2, click Downloads, click "Download .tar.gz"

Save this anywhere you can cd to via the terminal

Decompress the file

> tar -xzvf <downloaded_file>.tar.gz
> cd <new_folder>

Then install

> sudo python setup.py build
> sudo python setup.py install

Install setuptools for python2.5 if it complains for the same.

[4] Create a folder named deps within this boss_mashup_framework_0.1 directory:

boss_mashup_framework-0.1> mkdir deps

[5] Download the following 2 items into the deps folder:

dict2xml
http://dict2xml.googlecode.com/files/dict2xml.tar.gz

xml2dict
http://xml2dict.googlecode.com/files/xml2dict.tgz

[6] Decompress the two files from the last step from inside the deps folder:

boss_mashup_framework-0.1/deps/> tar -xzvf dict2xml.tar.gz
boss_mashup_framework-0.1/deps/> tar -xzvf xml2dict.tgz

[7] Within the boss_mashup_framework-0.1 directory, execute the following 2 commands:

sudo python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

[8] Set your user information (e.g. appid for V1, cc_key,cc_secrent,source_tag for V2) in the config.json file inside boss_mashup_framework-0.1 directory

[9] To test, execute the following command (from the same directory as above) with no errors:

python examples_v2/ex1.py


II. Usage
=========

Check out the source files in the "examples" directory for usage syntax

Also, take a look in the library sources for code documentation

Here's a quick library organization description:

yos.yql.db provides classes and functions for creating and remixing tables out of XML/JSON responses
yos.boss.ysearch provides a single function for fetching BOSS search results
yos.yql.udfs provides some handy user defined functions for yos.yql.db.select calls
yos.util.text provides some handy functions for processing and comparing text (strings)
yos.util.console provides a write function that prints messages to stdout despite encoding errors

When using yos.yql.db, keep in mind that for join calls
like join (inner_join), outer_join (left_outer_join)
that the first parameter (predicate function) should operate on row keys assuming no namespacing (field name text before the '$')
like row['yn$title'] => should be row['title'] within the predicate function code
This is because the predicate function is being applied like a map function,
so the order of the tables input (second parameter) does not matter
It also doesn't make sense when the number of tables exceeds 2
as a predicate function only operates on records from two tables at a time
